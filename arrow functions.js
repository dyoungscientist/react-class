// During class, it was mentioned that the arrow function was used a lot in react.
// it makes use of the let key word to declare the function name, the the function key word to define the parameters, and uses return to output the function body or the actual execution of the operation.
// example 
// normal function
function greet(name){
    console.log ("hello" + name)
}
greet ("Dara")
 // convert to arrow function: how it would be written in arrow function
 let greet_2 =(name) => {
    console.log ("hello" + name)
 }
